# 28nm Physical Design – Block Level

## Overview
This repository documents a **clean-room, block-level 28nm physical design flow**
performed in an academic environment.

The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate **physical design methodology,
flow understanding, and scripting skills**, without sharing any proprietary or
licensed data.

## Physical Design Flow Covered
- Floorplanning and Power Planning
- Placement and Optimization
- Clock Tree Synthesis (CTS)
- Routing
- Static Timing Analysis (STA)
- Timing Closure

---

## Tools (Academic / Industry Standard)
- Synopsys ICCII
- Synopsys StarRC
- Synopsys PrimeTime

---

## Repository Contents
- `docs/` – Screenshots and flow illustrations
- `scripts/` – Clean-room TCL scripts written manually
- `constraints/` – Generic timing constraints (SDC)

## Important Notes
- Proprietary PDKs, standard cell libraries, and tool databases are **NOT included**
- All scripts are written manually using **generic placeholders**
- This repository focuses on **flow and methodology**, not foundry IP
